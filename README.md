# Color-Flipper
This color Flipper is a practical project of mine on JavaScript. 

It comprises two parts:

a) the SIMPLE page where 50 predefined colors are selected one adter the other. This fixture has a prev and next button which enables easy movement from one color to another.
b) the HEX page is where the application dynamically generates colors randomly by itself, dynamically mix hex codes and create colors all by itself. 
The styling is simple and mobile responsive. You can suggest, add and improve on the project.
