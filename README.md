# Color-Flipper
This color Flipper is a practical project of mine on JavaScript. 
It comprises two parts:
a) the simple page where over 20 predefined colors are selected randomly.
b) the hex page whete the application dynamically generate colors by itself by randomly and dynamically mixing hex codes and create colors all by itself. 

The styling is simple and mobile responsive. You can suggest, add and improve on the project.
